## 3. What about 2? 
A bash script that displays the content of two files, `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/hosts`.

## 4. Last lines of a file 
A bash script that displays the last 10 lines of `/etc/passwd`.

> The `tail` command by default prints to standard output the last `10` lines of the input passed into it.
